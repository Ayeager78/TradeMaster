-  This is to be a ongoing project that I work on as I get the chance and the desire to do some coding.  I am new to the
coding world and I am currently learning and working with Python.  I have a little leisure and self taught experience with
SQL Server.

-  This code will likely not be complete for some time and most likely will never achieve perfection but it will be a great
learning experience and will one day be something that can be used as it was intended in it's creation.

-  I welcome any and all ideas on ways I can improve any code you see.  Contact me at ayeager78@gmail.com

-  All code in here is intended for me and this App.


Thanks!!!
