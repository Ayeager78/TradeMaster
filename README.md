A repository for a personal project or projects

05-15-13 (Andrew Yeager)

-  This is a project for the creation of software used to manage businesses in one of 3 major infrastructure trades
(Plumbing, Electrical, and HVAC).  It is intended to be effective in managing businesses that span different sectors of
each trade such as service & repair, new construction, and remodeling.  The project should be built as orthogonally as
possible.  Design shall have in mind a cloud based SAAS structure that can be viewed across multiple platforms and
devices.

-  This is to be a ongoing project that I work on as I get the chance and the desire to do some coding.  I am new to the
coding world and I am currently learning and working with Python.  I have a little leisure and self taught experience with
SQL Server.

-  This code will likely not be complete for some time and most likely will never achieve perfection but it will be a great
learning experience and will one day be something that can be used as it was intended in it's creation.

-  I welcome any and all ideas on ways I can improve any code you see.  Contact me at ayeager78@gmail.com

-  Just in the event I stumble upon something genius..... ***** All code in this repository is intended for me and
this application.  Using any of this code without my explicit consent (ayeager78@gmail.com) is forbidden.  *****
